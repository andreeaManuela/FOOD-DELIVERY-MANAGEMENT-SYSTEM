This application implements a food delivery management system for a catering company. The project has an interface with three types of users: admin, employee, and client. If a user wants to place an order, they must have an account; if they donâ€™t have one, they need to create it by pressing the Register button. A new window will appear where the user enters their details and can then log in. The client can view the menu, search for specific items by certain criteria, and place an order. When an order is placed, an invoice is generated. The administrator can add, modify, and delete menu items and generate reports regarding the orders made. The employee can always see when an order is placed.
The programming language is Java in IntelliJ, and the database is MySQL.
